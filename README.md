<h1>Warcraft Lobby Refresher</h1>
I'm really lazy, and hate sitting there entering !closeall !openall to refresh a lobby.

<h1>Solution?</h1>
Clearly the option was a python script, and you too can wield this power.

<h1>Usage</h1>
Open a terminal and run python wc3.py
Every minute it will open warcraft, select the chat and type in !closeall !openall then return back to your window.<br>
You will have to adjust the x,y coordinates of click as it is for my 2k monitor and I didnt use relative units.

<h1>Notes</h1>
Unsure if blizzard is okay with this, so uh if you get your account banned don't blame me ok thanks
